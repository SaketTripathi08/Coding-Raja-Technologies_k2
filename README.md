Description-
Creating a console-based budget tracker in Python with the specified features is a great project idea. Below is a step-by-step outline to help you get started:

1. Project Setup:

Create a new directory for your project.
Initialize a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
2. Transaction Class:

Define a Transaction class to represent individual expenses and income entries. This class should have attributes like category, amount, and date.
3. Transaction Manager:

Create a TransactionManager class to manage the list of transactions.
Implement methods for adding expenses and income entries.
Provide a way to categorize transactions.
4. Budget Calculation:

Implement budget calculation logic by subtracting total expenses from total income.
Keep track of the current budget balance.
5. Expense Analysis:

Implement functionality to categorize and analyze expenses.
Provide insights by displaying spending trends, such as monthly or category-wise summaries.
6. User Interface:

Create a command-line user interface (CLI) to interact with the application.
Allow users to input expenses and income entries, view their current budget, and access expense analysis.
7. Data Persistence:

Implement data persistence using file handling or a simple database library.
Store transaction data in a file or database for tracking over time.
8. Error Handling:

Implement error handling to gracefully handle incorrect user inputs.
9. Testing:

Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your application.
10. Documentation:

Create a README file that explains how to use your application and provides examples of commands and their expected outcomes.
